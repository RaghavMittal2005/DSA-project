# Introduction

This project aims to build a system that calculates **efficient routes** through a network using **graph-based algorithms** like Dijkstra,A* etc. The network is modeled as a graph, where nodes represent **routers or switches**, and edges represent **network links**. Each link is assigned a weight based on relevant metrics such as **bandwidth**, **latency**, or **link utilization**.

The system will also incorporate **load balancing techniques** to evenly distribute traffic across multiple paths, ensuring optimal performance and avoiding network congestion.

By dynamically adjusting pathfinding based on real-time network conditions, this system is adaptable for large-scale or complex network environments like **data centers** or **software-defined networks (SDNs)**.

This system is ideal for **network management**, **traffic optimization**, and ensuring **scalability** in evolving network topologies.
